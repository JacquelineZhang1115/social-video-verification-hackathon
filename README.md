# Detect Deepfakes with Social Video Verification

Deepfakes can spread misinformation, defamation, andpropaganda by faking videos of public speakers. In a future where deepfakes are visually indistinguishable fromreal video, how will we detect them? Help build a social verification system where people group at events to capture corroborating smartphone video and verify the truth! We have built a dataset of fakes and non-fakes with tracked facial features, and we challenge you to design an algorithm to detect the fakedÂ videos. Starter code and baseline metrics included!
